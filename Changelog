Next version (prototype_v0.0.2):
    - TLDR:
        - The main features of this version are:
            1) Correct growth miscalculation in control wells;
            2) Use the control wells to: a) infer the bacteria's growth pattern; and b) to correct black pixel thresholding value;
        - Deadline: 28th feb;

    - Main steps:
        1. Correct growth miscalculation in control wells;
            1. Both control wells should have at least 80% of the median growth of low concentration wells;
                - don't use average or max, due to no growth/contamination in low concentration wells;
                - This can be done by increasing the black pixel threshold incrementally in cv2.threshold() when recognizing growth in control wells;
            2. Both control wells should have similar growth values
                - Contamination can induce very different growth values

                - if the difference is >= 20%:
                    -error out and ask for manual inspection
                else:
                    - while both control wells do not have similar growth:
                        - decrease black pixel threshold of the one with high growth by 5;
                        - increase black pixel threshold of the one with low growth by 5;

        2. Use the control and low concentration wells to infer the growth pattern of the plate;
            1. 3 simple growth patterns for now (see below "To test" item for a better growth pattern to model dispersion):
                - Noise removal is needed here (remove very small contours)
                1.1. Dispersed (several small contours);
                1.2. Concentrated (few large contours, no small ones);
                1.3. Both (several small contours and few large ones);
                1.4. each control/low concentration well cast 1 vote. control wells votes are worth 1.25 (smallest growth) and 1.5 (highest growth) to reduce draws;
                1.5. most voted growth pattern is elected;

            2. When analysing each well:
                growth_pattern = Calculate growth pattern with default parameters;
                if growth_pattern is not what we expect:
                    if growth_pattern is dispersed and there one single large contour (very concentrated growth pattern):
                        - this is noise, most cases is condensation, return growth 0

                    if growth_pattern is a lot more disperse than what we expect and bubble filter is not applied:
                        apply bubble filter;
                        restart;

                    if growth_pattern is a lot more disperse than what we expect and bubble filter is already applied:
                        decrease black pixel threshold
                        restart;

        3. Use the control wells to infer the appropriate black pixel threshold when evaluating one well:
                1. while growth is a lot larger than the two control wells:
                    decrease black pixel threshold;



    - To test:
        - dispersion can be measured as the ratio of the area of all growth contours (i.e. nb of black pixels) over the convex hulls of the growth contours;
            - Note that it is the convex hull over the contours, not the less noisy convex hull
            - noise removal must be performed here
                - remove very small contours
                - remove contours on the border that might be noise
            - reference? https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05983
            - this gives a dispersion ration between 0 (very dispersed) and 1 (very concentrated) - it is a better model than what is written in main steps
