- Algorithm (to discuss together):
    - Multi-stage because it is too complex to infer everything in few steps

    1. Infer if there is growth
        - cut "very distant" points (threshold on x in the plot)
        - apply a lower threshold on y (noise reduction)
            -this also should take care of sedimentation
        - infer if there is growth
            - How?

    2. There is no growth:
        - label as no growth and quit (we dont care if it has bubbles, condensation, etc - no growth is no growth)

    3. There is growth. Infer if it is true growth

    4. Check if there are bubbles:
        - invert binarisation on white-ish pixels
        - if there are a lot of small blobs, then there are bubbles
            - label as bubbles and quit

    4. Check if there is condensation:
        - invert binarisation on white-ish pixels
        - if there is only one large (but <50% of the area) circular-ish (blob detection https://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/ , see circularity)
            - label as condensation and quit

    5. Here, there is growth, no shadows, no sediment, no bubbles and no condensation hopefully.
        - For now we ignore contamination and plate failure and whatever other issue that might happen

    6. Calculate growth
        - count the nb of black pixels / (region area)
            - This will include the noise in the border (should we care for now)?

    7. Label as growth and output percentage






- Cutting histogram
    - use a hard threshold based on sample images
    - Kerri

- For bubbles and condensation, flagging wells potentially having them is enough for now
    - If we identify growth and there are a bunch of pixels >= 190 -> flag
    - Tomorrow (both)
    - A better approach (for later):
        - http://www.huyaoyu.com/technical/2017/12/13/bubble-detection-by-using-opencv.html

- cut histogram based on threshold and normalize the growth
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Calculate growth, annotate growth in the image, add info that is pertinent to the report, and output a txt file with growth in each well
    - first version
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Validation step
    - Kerri
