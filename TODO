- BUBBLES ARE NOT AN ISSUE WITH ABSOLUTE THRESHOLD ANYMORE!
- Condensation still an issue
    4. Check if there is condensation:
        - invert binarisation on white-ish pixels
        - if there is only one large (but <50% of the area) circular-ish (blob detection https://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/ , see circularity)
            - label as condensation and quit

- Calculate growth
    - count the nb of black pixels / (region area)
        - This will include the noise in the border (should we care for now)?

- Label as growth and output percentage






- Cutting histogram
    - use a hard threshold based on sample images
    - Kerri

- For bubbles and condensation, flagging wells potentially having them is enough for now
    - If we identify growth and there are a bunch of pixels >= 190 -> flag
    - Tomorrow (both)
    - A better approach (for later):
        - http://www.huyaoyu.com/technical/2017/12/13/bubble-detection-by-using-opencv.html

- cut histogram based on threshold and normalize the growth
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Calculate growth, annotate growth in the image, add info that is pertinent to the report, and output a txt file with growth in each well
    - first version
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Validation step
    - Kerri
