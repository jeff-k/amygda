- Cutting histogram
    - use a hard threshold based on sample images
    - Kerri

- For bubbles and condensation, flagging wells potentially having them is enough for now
    - Tomorrow (both)
    - A better approach (for later):

- cut histogram based on threshold and normalize the growth
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Calculate growth, annotate growth in the image, add info that is pertinent to the report, and output a txt file with growth in each well
    - first version
    - Tomorrow (both)

- Validation step
    - Kerri
